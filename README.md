# Qiskit Hackathon at World of Quantum (June 2023)

This project implements the ground state preparation of the Toric code on IBM's heavy-hex lattice structure. It implements it in both a naive way, directly following the implementation on Google's Sycamore quantum processor by K. J. Satzinger et al. (2021), and in an adjusted version, optimized for IBM's heavy-hex lattice structure.
